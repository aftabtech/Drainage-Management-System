# Drainage-Management-System (Using IoT)
<h2>1.INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drainage system is an important component of cities. It is considered to be cityâ€™s lifeline. Mostly,the management on drainage is manual by workers, therefore it is not efficient to have a clean working system. Moreover, in such big cities, it is difficult for the government's personnel to locate the exact area which a blockage occures until it is notified by the local people. Therefore, it is important to develop a system which can handle drainage overflow which is the result of blockages, without human interfere. This project describes various functions used for maintaining and monitoring of underground drainage system. It provides a system which is able to monitor the water level, water flow, atmospheric temperature, and toxic gasses. If drainage system gets blocked and water overflows it can be identified by the sensors of system. Then sensors send information via the transmitter which is located in that particular area to the corresponding managing station.</p>

&nbsp;<h3>1.1Problem Statement<h3>
	<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today's drainage system is not high-tech. So whenever there is blockage it is difficult to figure out the exact location of the blockage. Also, early alerts of the blockage are not received. Hence detection and repairing of the blockage become time consuming.  It becomes very inconvenient to handle the situation when pipes are blocked completely. Due to such failure of drainage line, people face a lot of problems.</p> 
 
<h4>Objectives</h4>
<ol>
  <li>	Detect the location  </li>
  <li>	The system governing the flow of sewage from the pipes.  </li>
  <li>	Use of flow sensors to detect the variations in the flow. </li>
  <li>	Get the prior alerts of blockages and locate them using IOT. Trace location using GPS and send SMS through GSM.</li></ol>
